          <span class="bold">1996</span>
          <br/>
        With the 13th pick in the 1996 NBA Draft, the Charlotte Hornets selected Kobe Bryant, the teenage phenom from Lower Merion High School in Philadelphia. He’d earned four state championships in four years, but his stint with the Hornets wouldn’t last nearly as long. They traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Vlade Divac. At age 17, Bryant was still considered a minor. His parents had to cosign his three-year, $3.5 million rookie contract.
          <br/>
          <span class="bold">1997</span>
          <br/>
        Bryant was 18 by the time All-Star Weekend rolled around. He didn’t make the team, but he did participate in the Rookie Challenge, and he won the Slam Dunk Contest.
          <br/> 
          <span class="bold">1999-2002</span>
          <br/>
        The Lakers had been to the playoffs with Bryant and Shaq, but hadn't reached championship form. When phil Jackson arrived he had already won six titles with the Chicago Bulls. He added three more titles with the Lakers in 2000,2001 and 2002. This still remains the last time a team won three in a row.
          <br/>
          <span class="bold">2004</span>
          <br/>
        Bryant and O'neal had often butted heads since they teamed up in 1996. Both parties had issues with the way the other played or acted on and off the court and in the summer following the dissapointing end to the 2004 finals the Lakers declined to retain Jackson as their coach. This was quickly followed with O'neal demanding a trade, and the next day Kobe signing an extension for 7 years worth $136.
          <br/>
          <span class="bold">2006</span>
          <br/>
        On Jan. 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points in a regular season game. This became the second highest total points scored, with only Wilt's 100 points out in front.
          <br/>
          <span class="bold">2008</span>
          <br/>
        After a humilating defeat in the 2004 olympics, Kobe joined the team for the 2008 games. His presence changed the attitude of the team and with his 13 points in the final quarter of the gold medal game propelled them to win it all.
          <br/>
          <span class="bold">2008-2010</span>
          <br/>
        Although already a champion, many people felt Kobe needed to prove he could do it without Shaq. With the help of Paul Gasol the Lakers returned to the top of the west. They would be knocked off in the 08 finals by the overpowered Celtics, but Kobe went on to win in both 09 and 2010, defeating the rival Celtics for his 5th and final championship.
          <br/>
          <span class="bold">2012</span>
          <br/>
        Although Bryant wouldn't win another NBA championship after 2010, he stil had time to add to his throphy case. In 2012 he returned to the olympics as a veteran and won his final gold medal.
          <br/>
          <span class="bold">2016 - 'Dear Basketball'</span>  
          <br/>
        Bryant spent the rest of his career chasing a sixth NBA title, which would have tied him with Michael Jordan. But injuries plagued him his final few seasons. On Nov. 29, 2015, Bryant published a poem in The Players Tribune, titled “Dear Basketball.” In it, he announced that he would be retiring at the end of the season. On April 13, 2016, Bryant played in his final NBA game going out ona season high 60 points.
          <br/>  
        <span class="bold">2017 - Jersey Retirment</span>
          <br/>
        On Dec. 18, 2017, the Lakers retired Bryant’s jersey numbers, 24 and 8. He is the only player in NBA history with two numbers retiered by the same team.
          <br/>
          <span class="bold">2018 - Oscar Winner</span>
          <br/>
        In April 2017, Bryant made an animated short film out of his “Dear Basketball” poem. The following March, he added another trophy to his collection. “Dear Basketball” won the Oscar for Best Animated short Film at the 90th Academy Awards. The film also took home a Sports Emmy and the Annie Award that year.

          <span class="bold">2020 - Manba Mentality</span>
          <br/>
        On January 26th, 2020, Kobe and his daughter Gigi were taking a helicopter to a basketball game Gigi was playing in. Kobe had started a team for young girls of which his daughter shined as part of. It was on this journey that tragedy would strike. The helicopter crash took the lives of Kobe and Gigi, along with the pilot, two parents and their daughter, another mother and daughter and the teams coach. Tributes were paid across the world, with the NBA doing several things to honor Kobe. Every team in their first game started out recording a 24 second and 8 second violations to honor the two jersey numbers kobe wore and the All-Star MVP throphy was renamed after him.
